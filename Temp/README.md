Humans not only take debts to manage necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. 

Insights Highlights:

* China’s large debt reflects its substantial borrowing for development and infrastructure projects, aligning with its massive economic scale.
* Timor-Leste, being a small developing nation, has minimal debt repayment obligations relative to other countries.
* The dataset highlights diverse debt levels and repayment behaviors among developing nations, emphasizing the varied stages of economic growth and borrowing capacity.
