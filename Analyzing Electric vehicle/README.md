As electronic vehicles (EVs) become more popular, there is an increasing need for access to charging stations, also known as ports. To that end, many modern apartment buildings have begun retrofitting their parking garages to include shared charging stations. A charging station is shared if it is accessible by anyone in the building.

But with increasing demand comes competition for these ports — nothing is more frustrating than coming home to find no charging stations available! In this project, you will use a dataset to help apartment building managers better understand their tenants’ EV charging habits.

Highlights and Insights:

* Some garages attract significantly more unique users, suggesting higher EV adoption or better accessibility.
* These high-usage garages may need additional charging ports or scheduling systems to reduce wait times.
* The most popular charging times are typically weekday evenings (6 PM–9 PM), when residents return from work.
* Weekend morning activity is also notable but less intense.
* These findings suggest potential for dynamic pricing or reservation systems during evening peak hours to balance usage.
* A small subset of users habitually occupy charging stations for long periods, reducing availability for others.
* These users may need targeted communication or policy reminders to encourage responsible usage.
